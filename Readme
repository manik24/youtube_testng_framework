first we maintain our testcases in the excel file
in the format of testcaseid, description, package name, class name
and status
why we are passing status-because with the help of status
we will drive/testcases our test cases
there is a concept of base package in base package we are 
handling the browser and handling the properties file
for testscripts we have maintained a package in that 
package we are maintaining all the testscripts
for reusable/common pages we have use the concept of
page object model, so what is page object model its a 
design pattern its a way of working we are defining
operation as per the page architecture means if there
are multiple sections on the page we will design the
method as per the sections on the page and we are calling
that methods as per the requirement in the testcase
and for the comparison between expected and actual result
we are using assertions.
and we have designed some utilities as well like screenshot
capture, logs capture, drop down handling,excel file handling
for logs capturing we are using the apache log4j librarry
and there is a concept of trigger class that will the
trigger the whole framework and after that you need to
explain all the responsibilites of trigger class 
and for the locators we are maintaining in the properties file
and all the jars we are passing using pom.xml to our maven project
and all the exe of the browsers we are maintaining in the browser
folder and test cases excel file we are attaching with the project.
and for source code management we are using GitHub
and for the build tool we are using maven
